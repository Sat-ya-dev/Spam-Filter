# Spam-Filter
I wrote a python programme which would take a sentence as an input and classify it as spam or non-spam message based on the data in sms.csv file. The output is determined by the probability of occurrence of the words(using bayeâ€™s theorem) in the input present under spam or non spam labels in csv file.
